          <h3>Elephant</h3>
          <p>Poachers target elephants for ivory. Killing adults breaks herd structure, leaves calves orphaned, and reduces reproduction because older females carry knowledge of migration routes and water sources. Heavy poaching can shift elephants into smaller, more fearful groups and push them into riskier areas, increasing human–wildlife conflict. Population losses also damage ecosystems because elephants are “landscape engineers” that open forests and spread seeds.</p>

        <div class="animal">
            <img src="images/bengal-tiger.jpg">
            <h3>Bengal Tiger</h3>
            <p>Bengal tigers are apex predators that need large territories, dense cover, and healthy prey (deer, wild boar). Poaching targets them for skins and body parts used in illegal wildlife trade, and snares set for other animals also kill tigers “by accident.” When a breeding adult is poached, it can empty an entire area because cubs may starve and neighboring tigers fight to take over territory. Fewer tigers can lead to prey overpopulation, which can damage forests and farmland.</p>

        <div class="animal">
            <img src="images/blackRhino.jpeg">
            <h3>Black Rhino</h3>
            <p>Rhinos are poached mainly for their horns. Because rhinos reproduce slowly (long pregnancies, few calves), even small increases in adult deaths can cause long-term population collapse. Poaching removes breeding adults, disrupts territories, and can leave calves vulnerable. The constant threat changes behavior—rhinos may avoid prime habitats, making them harder to protect and reducing access to good food and water.</p>

            <img src="images/giraffe.jpg">
            <h3>Giraffe</h3>
            <p>Giraffes are poached for meat, hides, and tails, and local declines can happen quietly because they roam wide areas. Losing adults reduces calf survival because calves rely on experienced females for protection and movement patterns. Poaching can also skew sex ratios, lowering future reproduction. Fewer giraffes can change plant growth patterns because giraffes shape trees and shrubs through browsing.<p>

          <div class="animal">
              <img src="images/pangolin.jpg">
              <h3>Pangolin</h3>
              <p>Pangolins are poached for their scales and meat, making them among the most trafficked mammals. They are solitary, slow-breeding, and stress easily, so populations rebound poorly after losses. Poaching and trafficking remove adults faster than they can reproduce, fragmenting local populations. Declines can increase termite and ant numbers, which may affect crops and natural habitats.</p>

              <img src="images/seaCow.jpg">
              <h3>Steller’s sea cow</h3>
              <p>Steller’s sea cow shows how hunting one species can indirectly wipe out another. Fur traders heavily hunted sea otters, which normally keep sea urchins under control. With fewer otters, urchins exploded and overgrazed kelp forests—the sea cow’s main food. So even while people were hunting sea cows directly, their habitat was also collapsing and food was disappearing. This “trophic cascade” made the sea cows much more vulnerable and likely sped up their extinction by 1768.</p>
